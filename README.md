# Open SDG Config Form

This repository holds the code for the configuration forms used in Open SDG. It also hosts the built JavaScript files which are used by Open SDG.

These forms use the excellent [JSONForms](https://jsonforms.io/) open-source library.

## Available versions

* Latest code: https://open-sdg.org/open-sdg-config-form/bundle.js
* Version 2.3.1: https://open-sdg.org/open-sdg-config-form/2.3.1/bundle.js

## Dependencies

* Node.js

## Development

To build the project:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

Include the built JavaScript files on your page. Open SDG uses the Github-hosted files like so:

```
<script src="https://open-sdg.org/open-sdg-config-form/bundle.js"></script>
```

This code expects a certain JavaScript object to exist. Here is a rundown of what it is expecting:

```
var opensdg = opensdg || {};
opensdg.configForm = {
  schema: null,          // The JSONSchema for the form
  uiSchema: null,        // The UI Schema according to JSONForms
  initialData: null,     // Existing data to populate the form
  configFilename: null,  // The name of file that will be generated by the form
  configFolder: null,    // The path to the folder in a target repository that the file will be uploaded to
  githubClientId: null,  // ClientID if using a direct connection to Github
  githubProxyUrl: null,  // Proxy URL if using a direct connection to Github
  githubRepo: null,      // The name of the Github repo that the file will be uploaded to
  githubOwner: null,     // The owner (organization) of the Github repo that the file will be uploaded to
  repositoryLink: null,  // The full link to the repository that the file will be uploaded to
};
```
